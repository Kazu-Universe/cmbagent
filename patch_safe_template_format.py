"""
One-time patch: makes OpenAIWrapper.instantiate's template formatting
resilient to missing context keys, fixing an entire class of KeyError
crashes we've hit repeatedly - agent YAML prompts referencing template
variables ({inspirehep_context}, {current_code_output}, etc.) that aren't
always populated in context_variables, depending on which agents actually
ran and what they did.

Root cause: template.format(**context) raises KeyError on any missing key.
We've been finding and removing these placeholders from our own YAML files
one at a time as each one crashes a different agent - a fragile, unbounded
process. This patches the actual chokepoint instead: missing keys now
resolve to an empty string, matching how the code already treats an
entirely-missing/falsy context (returns the template as-is at the top of
the function) - just extended to the per-key case.

Run once after any fresh install/venv rebuild:
    python patch_safe_template_format.py
