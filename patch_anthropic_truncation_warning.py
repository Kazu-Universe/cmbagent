Patch: surface silent truncation in autogen's Anthropic wrapper instead of
producing an empty message with no error.

BUG: in autogen/oai/anthropic.py's create() method, the branch that handles
non-tool_use stop_reasons does:

    else:
        anthropic_finish = "stop"
        tool_calls = None

...and then only extracts message_text from a TextBlock if one is present.
When response.stop_reason == "max_tokens" (Claude hit the token limit while
generating - e.g. mid-way through constructing a tool_use block, with no
preceding prose), this branch fires, discards any partial tool call, finds
no TextBlock to fall back on, and silently returns
{'content': '', 'tool_calls': None} - no exception, no warning, nothing.

CONFIRMED in a real cmbagent deep_research() run: engineer's turn hit
exactly max_tokens (16000, see patch_raise_max_tokens.py) twice on a heavy
combined sympy+synthesis task, both times producing a totally empty message.
Since this is caught by autogen's normal group-chat flow (not a raised
exception), deep_research() finished cleanly and printed "=== DONE ===" as
if nothing had gone wrong, while the most safety-critical final round of
work silently never happened.

FIX: when stop_reason == "max_tokens" and no usable content/tool_calls were
extracted, set message_text to an explicit, visible truncation notice and
emit a Python warning, so this shows up directly in the transcript and in
stdout instead of disappearing.

This does NOT recover the lost partial generation (Anthropic's API does not
return usable partial tool-call JSON for a mid-truncation cutoff) - it only
makes the failure loud instead of silent, so it can be caught and retried
(e.g. by asking for a smaller sub-task, or raising max_tokens further) the
same turn rather than discovered much later by manually reading raw JSON.
